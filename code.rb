  def backstory
    "Adrenaline junkie and MMA fighter Brian ‘The Brawler’ Baker, was known to throw a fight or two if the money was right. After all, fighting didn’t pay well and MMA training isn’t cheap. He did have ambitions to become champion some day, and when his chance finally came he was ready. What he wasn’t expecting was the fix he was expected to throw in this ‘the fight of his life’. Having refused, it was no wonder that he met with an unfortunate accident in the ring that left him clinging to life in a hospital for months. When his body healed and was un-bandaged for the first time, he and his doctors were amazed to discover the muscles had repaired themselves at 20 times the strength commonly found in such injuries. He was, in fact, too strong to ever compete again. Dismayed and depressed, he was found by the Launcher League and invited to use his strength for something positive."

    "Private Luke Bayne, while walking his late night beat, accidentally ate toxic-frosted yellow-cake donuts and awoke the next morning with over heightened senses that make him acutely hyperaware of his surroundings. He has managed to channel these skills into his chosen calling, but having gone from being an inept foot-patroller to the keenest of investigators, he is now suspected of being corrupt and under and EA investigation that has no proof, only speculation. Taking his new found skills underground, he has teamed up with the Launcher League to do good and fight crime all while remaining mild-mannered Private Luke Bayne amongst his colleagues."
